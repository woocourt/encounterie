</font><center><b><font size="70">How Does It Work</b></font></center>
<center><h2><b>INTRO</h2></b></center>
<center><h3>We are not a <u>Hook Up Site</u> neither a so called <u>Dating Platforn!</u></h3></center>

<center>Surfing through hundreds of profiles, gazing over thousands of pictures on traditional websites and swiping over millions of photographs on mobile applications is an <b>activity of the past!</b></center> 
<br><b>Fact and figures about most online dating websites/mobile apps</b>
<br>The vast majority of the participants on dating side hardly ever <b> telling the truth</b>about themselves and rarely do they upload their accurate and recent up to date photographs.
<br> Most of them mislead by giving false information, over their appearance and status, bending the rules, while faking the truth and hoping to make up for it, 
<br>on the spot, on the very day of the date. 
<br>While improvising, using the most unbelievable, but rather entertaining, incredible but in reality extremely sad stories and mind-blowing excuses.
<br>In most cases, this dates end up in a tragedy and both parties take the journey home in anger and utter disappointment, and asking themselves:
<br>&rdquo;<b>Do I really need this?&rdquo;</b> 
<br>Just in time, after they have answered they own question with:
<br><b>&rdquo;No I do not need this?&rdquo;</b>...and just a couple of days later the so called <u>phase two</u> kicks in.
<br>The war of email bullying and late night phone calls, with withdrew phone numbers begins and in some <br>cases <b>even stalking</b>, if one had mention where their work or which underground station they are using to commute.. 
<br>Also some of your pictures could be circulated on social media platforms, with your gathered details underneath <br>them or used to set up false profiles on other <b>Hook Up Sites</b>.
<p> 
<br>Therefore, most of the dating sites are counterproductive, time consuming, humiliating and frustrating, mentally, but 
<br>also financially. No of this so called <b>Meat Markets</b> working for people who have <b>respect for themself.</b>
<br>One pays a month/yearly subscription fee, which in most cases allows one to approach every single member in the database, which is crazy beyond words. 
<br>Those <b>meat markets</b> do not want you to meet a person and settle done, because they would lose a paying member. 
<br>They are in for the profit and not for the success. Furthermore one will be exposed to information on profile, which are full of <b>alternative facts</b>, falsehoods and then spends money to travel to the dates, <br>spends a small fortune on food and drinks and then the end outcome is a <b>one night stand,</b> under drunk conditions (ONS) if one is &rdquo;lucky&rdquo;. 
<br> The morning after a person next to one, looking completely different, almost unrecognisable to the person one met the night before, after the makeup, the painted eye borrows and the fake tan embedding themself  into the white pillow case decorated with the unglued fake eyelashes. 
<br>Some of the “modern men” do ware make up and fake tan too, just wanted to point it out to make sure we do not point finger toward the ladies.
Those are just a few of the lines which makes one very depressive, after most of the dates which do not end up between the sheets: 
<br><b>&#x25B6You are a such a nice person, but not my type.
<br>&#x25B6 Let us keep in touch. 
<br>&#x25B6 Just let us stay best friends.</b>
<br>So let us face it, even if the dates goes well, there is very little hope that the participants stay together, because everyone is looking for the perfect partner and as soon something unpleasant pops up in the relationship, people start swiping again, this time with fake profiles and pictures just in case the other partner is <b>still online</b> too. <u>This is an absolute misery</u>. We believe whoever online dated experienced this at least once!

<br>Of course all of us heard true stories and it not impossible to find the <b>love of your life</b> on one of those sides, but the amount of work and time you have to put in is biblical. 
<br>If one approaches <b>200 people a day</b> with the very same copied and pasted massage, there is a reasonable chance that eventually at some stage someone will fit the bill. 
<br>
<br>Do you want to be surrounded by everyone, who pays a fee to a dating site or do you want to be approached <u>only</u> by individuals, 
<br>you have chosen and whom are sharing the same or very similar interests with you and appreciating the same values as you?

<br><center>The answer is very simple</center>  <center><u><b>YOU DO NOT WANT TO</u></b></center> 
<br>
<br>Why should anyone in a health state of mind, someone who really wants to meet a genuine person and settle done, pay monthly 
<br>upfront fee, to any company and then still have to spend hundreds of hours to search and a tone of wasted time dating the fakes?
<br>
<br><center>The answer is  apparent</center>  <center><u><b>YOU SHOULD NOT</u></b></center>
